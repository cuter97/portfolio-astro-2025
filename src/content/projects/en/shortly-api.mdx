# Shortly API

This project was a frontend mentor challenge. The challenge involves integrating the rel.ink API into a web user interface to create shortened URLs, which should be displayed according to the proposed design. I took this opportunity to gain more experience with asynchronous JavaScript. It is one of my first projects and was completed in 2022.
