## Challenge and Solutions

- **Performance vs. Motion**: Achieved ultra-fast loading speeds while maintaining professional-grade GSAP transitions and scroll-triggered animations through Astro's partial hydration strategy.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Implemented a centralized content system using a `labels.ts` file and TypeScript-powered configurations, allowing easy updates across all pages without touching core code.
- **Production-Ready Contact**: Developed a secure contact form with server-side Zod validation and Resend API integration, including optional Upstash Redis anti-spam protection.
- **Unique Portfolio Experience**: Created a sticky card stacking effect for the desktop project showcase, where cards stack with scale animations for a memorable browsing experience.

## Features

- Ultra-fast Performance: Built with Astro 5 for optimal loading speeds and top-tier SEO optimization.
- Smooth Motion Design: Professional GSAP-powered transitions, scroll-triggered animations, and Lenis smooth scrolling.
- Complete Page Set: Includes Home, Works (Portfolio), Studio (About), Contact, Services, and Legal pages with individual project detail pages generated from Markdown.
- Type-Safe Configuration: All site data (team, services, values, testimonials) managed through TypeScript for error-free customization.
- Smart Navbar: Header that shrinks and gains rounded corners on scroll via GSAP animations.
- Responsive Design: Meticulously optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing experiences.

## Future Improvements

- Multi-language Support: Leverage the existing `labels.ts` structure to implement full internationalization (i18n).
- Headless CMS Integration: Connect content collections to platforms like Sanity or Contentful for non-technical content management.
- Advanced Analytics: Integrate project view tracking and visitor behavior insights.
