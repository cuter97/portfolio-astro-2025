# Portfolio Website

This project is a custom platform to showcase my work, skills, and experience in web development. Designed with a modern and minimalist approach, the portfolio offers an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.

## Challenge and Solutions
- Dark Mode: Implemented a dynamic system for switching between light and dark modes, enhancing accessibility and user experience personalization.
- Multilanguage Support: Added support for English and Spanish, allowing users to easily switch between languages.
- Responsive Design: The portfolio is fully optimized for mobile devices, ensuring smooth and responsive viewing across all screen sizes.

## Features
- Built with Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui
- Animations created using GSAP and Astro Transition
- Language switching implemented with i18n

## Future Improvements

- Admin Profile: I would like to implement an admin profile to dynamically add and manage content.
- Dynamic Projects Section: Automate the loading of projects from a GitHub repository.
