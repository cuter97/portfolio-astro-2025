# BANYAN STUDIO – Template for Creative Digital Studios

**Banyan Studio** is a professional, high-performance template designed for creative studios, design agencies, and digital teams looking to stand out with a sophisticated web presence. The project combines the speed of Astro 5 with professional-grade animations powered by GSAP, delivering a dark, modern, and completely fluid visual experience.

The core focus of the project is **motion as a design language**: every section comes to life through scroll-triggers, sticky card stacking, and interactive work process panels — all orchestrated with precision to communicate the premium identity of a creative studio.

## Developer Experience (DX)

The project was built with scalability and long-term maintainability in mind:

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between common, UI, and page section components, organized in `common/`, `ui/`, and `sections/` layers.
- **Typed Configuration**: Config files in `src/config/` for services, projects, team, and navigation — all powered by TypeScript.
- **Global Theme System**: Easy customization of colors, typography, and spacing via CSS variables in `global.css`.
- **Premium Typography**: Tanker and Clash Grotesk fonts included and configured at the theme level with Tailwind.
- **SSR-Safe Animations**: Client guards, cleanup via `gsap.context()`, and re-initialization on page transitions to prevent flickering.
- **Production Ready**: Pre-configured with the Vercel adapter for deployment with edge functions.

## Summary

**Banyan Studio** is a robust technical foundation and visually sophisticated starting point for any creative digital studio. It perfectly balances the speed of a static site with the power of a functional backend, offering a premium launchpad for agencies and studios that want to showcase their technical depth and aesthetic sensibility from day one.
