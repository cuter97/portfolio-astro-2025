For a long time, I used **Next.js** for my personal site and blog. I’ve always liked working with **React**, so Next felt like the natural choice.  
But over time, I started to notice something: maintaining a static site with Next.js was way more complicated than it needed to be.

Every time I wanted to add a new post or update some information, I had to touch the code, rebuild everything, and wait. Since I don’t use a CMS or database, all my content is static — and in theory, that should be simple… but with Next, it just wasn’t.

## Next.js is great, but not for everything

No doubt about it: Next.js is a powerful framework.  
If you’re building a complex app, an admin dashboard, or something that needs SSR, API routes, and authentication, it’s amazing.

The issue comes when your project **doesn’t need all that**.  
A simple blog, portfolio, or static site ends up carrying way more weight than it should.

Some things that frustrated me:

- The **bundle size** was large even for simple pages.
- Adding content required setting up **contentlayer** or other extra tools.
- Each new post meant changing routes or rebuilding everything.
- The setup felt heavier and heavier over time.

At some point, it feels like you’re using a **jackhammer to hang a picture frame**.

## Then I found Astro

One day, almost by accident, I started experimenting with **Astro**, and it completely changed my workflow.

The first thing that struck me was **how simple it is to build things**.  
Astro follows a _“content-first”_ philosophy — it’s designed for sites that prioritize content, not apps.

I was able to create a fully functional blog in minutes, without installing any extra dependencies.  
No need to set up contentlayer or routing. You just create a Markdown file in `src/content`, and Astro handles the rest: it generates routes, provides type safety, and even validates metadata automatically.

And the **performance is incredible**. Astro ships zero JavaScript by default and only loads it when you ask for it, which means blazing-fast pages and super lightweight output.

## Still using React (but as an island)

The best part is I didn’t have to abandon React.  
Astro lets me use it **only when I really need it**, as an isolated “island” within the page.

For example, if I need an interactive component or a small visual effect, I can use my usual React components — hooks, props, everything — without affecting the performance of the rest of the site.

I didn’t have to rewrite anything in plain TypeScript or change how I think about components.  
Astro just gives me the freedom to choose **when and where** to use React.

## Comparing the experience

| Aspect             | Next.js                              | Astro                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Bundle size        | Large, even for simple sites         | Minimal by default             |
| Content management | Needs contentlayer or external tools | Built-in `content collections` |
| Learning curve     | Steeper for static sites             | Very low                       |
| Performance        | Good, but heavier with JS            | Excellent, 0 JS by default     |
| React              | Fully dependent                      | Optional, as needed            |

## My current workflow

These days, writing a new blog post is literally **just creating a Markdown file**.  
Astro takes care of everything else — routing, layouts, type checking, and rendering.

I use **TailwindCSS** for styling and **React** for interactive components (like menus or hover effects).  
Everything else is static, clean, and fast.

I no longer worry about bundle size or unnecessary dependencies.  
I just write and publish.

## Conclusion

Migrating to Astro made my life a lot easier.  
Now, whenever I want to **add new information or update something**, I can do it effortlessly — no extra tools, no complex setup.

With Next, even changing something small like a piece of text or a section felt like too many steps.  
With Astro, everything is more direct: open a file, change it, done.

It wasn’t just a change in technology, but a **change in workflow**.  
Maintaining my site is now faster, lighter, and much more practical.
