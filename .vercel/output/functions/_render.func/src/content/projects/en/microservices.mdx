# Microservices
This project is part of the microservices course at DevTalles Academy. It uses Nest.js to create scalable services, Docker for containerization, and NATS for asynchronous communication between microservices. The services include product management, orders, payments, and authentication.

## Features

- Microservices communicated via NATS
- Containerization with Docker
- Product, order, and payment management.

## Future Improvements

- Create an admin profile to dynamically add information
- Improve event management and communication between microservices using advanced messaging design patterns.
